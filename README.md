# Understanding housing prices

The plan:

First I will scrape the following websources for pricing information:

* https://www.trulia.com/
* https://www.zillow.com/
* https://streeteasy.com/
* https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites

Once I have sufficient pricing data, I will try to understand why prices are the way they are.

## Installation

In order to carry out this project, I needed some extra tools.  So in order to get the scraper to work, you'll need [chromeheadless-driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).  [Here's the documentation](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) on how to get started. 

All other installs can be found in `requirements.txt` found at the base of the project.  And installed with:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
