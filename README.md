# Understanding housing prices

The plan:

First I will scrape the following websources for pricing information:

* https://www.trulia.com/
* https://www.zillow.com/
* https://streeteasy.com/
* https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites

Once I have sufficient pricing data, I will try to understand why prices are the way they are.
